<h1>Dear Drone lyrics</h1>
<pre>Dear drone, it's not you, it's me
But...

When you hover over me all day
I feel safe but also feel my social life melting away
I'm not saying that your caring is a crime
I just like to wipe my own butt from time to time
And I think that you could make new friends
verse
Like the 3D printer, in Graphic Arts
Or the Theragun Massager or the Yellow Cuisinart
I'm not saying I don't like you Mr. Drone
I just want to have the smallest hope, just visible in a microscope
Of somehow
Not dying alone
outro
It's not you, it's me

</pre>
